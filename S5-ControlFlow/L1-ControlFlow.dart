// Let's start with a basic iteration loop like every programming language course has

void main() {
  // so to break it down, the for loop is composed of 4 main components.
  // Initialization, Condition, Execution and Iteration.
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    print("current value of i = $i");
  }
}
